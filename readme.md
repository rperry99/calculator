## Thoughts

It was really interesting to see how this project was built. I had created a calculator in the past, can be found [here at this repo](https://github.com/rperry99/jQuery-calculator-FPI). My version had way more LOC in it, and I used a bunch of switch statements inside of if statements which I now realize was totally uneccessary.

This is one of the reasons I wanted to take this course. I really like seeing the different ways people code the same project, and it helps me learn different ways that I can do something. Usually, I find a better way than the way I have done it before.
